# drupal-purger
This module allows Section’s global, distributed caching layer to quickly respond to invalidation events from a Drupal instance in exactly the same way that Drupal’s internal cache or a local varnish cache running on the host machine does, ensuring that the content in Section’s global caching layer is always up to date.
